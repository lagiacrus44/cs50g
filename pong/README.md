### Player 1 is AI powered.
### Player 2 is YOU!

### 3 attributes added to Paddle class:
1. Speed multiplier - implemented for AI. It is calculated each serve and goes from 0.5 to 1.2.
2. Margin - Works as a buffer for the y coordinate that the Paddle will try to stay nearby to.
3. Incoming - Added for the optional functionality of the AI paddle moving only when the ball was incoming to it. Removed usage for the paddle to move at all times, as per the project request.

#### Thanks!
